    "## Working With the Program\n",
    "The program implements the standard bisection method for root finding.\n",
    "The root-finding problem is expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are given a function $f(x)$ taking a real number and returning a\n",
    "> real number; that is a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The function is negative at some point $x_0$ and\n",
    "> positive at some point $x_1$. Find the value $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$\n",
    "> on an interval $[Lower,Upper]$. The point $x$ is a root of $f$ on the\n",
    "> interval $[Lower,Upper]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the natural logarithm function, $ln$. The graph\n",
    "in Figure 1 shows the values of $ln(x)$ for various values\n",
    "of $x$. We can see that the value of $ln(x)$ is equal to 0 when $x=1$.\n",
    "The bisection algorithm finds this value of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SWEN90006/tutorials/main/figures/Log-Graph.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>Figure 1: Root finding problems.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the algorithm for finding roots is to look at the\n",
    "interval $[Lower,Upper]$ and bisect it (hence the name of the algorithm)\n",
    "and find the midpoint of the interval $x_r$. If we know that\n",
    "$f(\\mathit{Lower})$ is negative, and $f(\\mathit{Upper})$ is positive\n",
    "then there must be root in the interval, provided that the function is\n",
    "continuous. If the value of $f$ at $x_r$ is positive then the root must\n",
    "be in the interval $[Lower,x_r]$. If the value of $f$ at $x_r$ is\n",
    "negative then the root must be in the interval $[x_r,Upper]$. The\n",
    "algorithm should converge to the root because the length of the interval\n",
    "is getting smaller every time (in fact the length of the interval is\n",
    "halved every time). Does this sound familiar?"

    "1. What is the input domain for the `Bisection` program below?\n",

    "2. Draw the control-flow graph for the `Bisection` function. You may break the function up into basic blocks to simplify your CFG.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Recall** that a *basic block* is a continuous sequence of statements where control flows from one statement to the next, a single point of entry, a single point of exit and no branches or loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose that we concentrated on the (nice and linear) function $f(x) = x - 2$. Derive a set of test cases that can:\n",
    "    - Execute every statement of the program under test at least once. Formally we call it achieving 100% statement coverage \n",
    "    - Each condition if a branch is made to evaluate to true and false at least once. Formally we call it achieving 100% condition coverage. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note that you will have to determine what it means for the `Bisection` function to return the *correct* or *expected* output first.\n",
