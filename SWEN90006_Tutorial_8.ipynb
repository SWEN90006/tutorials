    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is for you to familiarise yourself with code coverage-guided fuzzing tools like AFL. In the class exercise last week (Week 8), we used generation-based/model-based black-box fuzzing tools like Peach fuzzer to generate inputs to trigger the faults in two versions of the read_and_process program. In this tutorial, you will use AFL to do the same task. "

    "## Working with programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the instructions at https://github.com/SWEN90006-2021/security-testing to setup a Docker image and Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First program: read_and_process_v1.c\n",
    "\n",
    "To trigger the fault, called FAULT-1, in this simpler version of read_and_process, AFL needs to generate an input file that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "-\tThe file should adhere to the structure of the expected file format. Recall that a valid file starts with a 4-byte \"signature\", followed by a list of chunks and each chunk has three parts: i) a chunk type stored in 4 bytes, ii) a 4-byte data length, and iii) the chunk data.\n",
    "-\tThe list of chunks should have at least one data chunk of the \"BOOM\" type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile read_and_process_v1.c with afl-clang-fast so that AFL can be used to fuzz test the generated binary with code coverage feedback enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "afl-clang-fast -g -o read_and_process_v1 read_and_process_v1.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run AFL to fuzz test the program in four settings. If your computer has enough CPU cores (>= 4 cores), you can start four docker containers and run four settings at the same time to speed up the experiments. You can stop AFL by typing down the combination \"Ctrl + C\". You can also set up a timeout for each command if you wish by using the timeout command (see https://linuxize.com/post/timeout-command-in-linux/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting-1\n",
    "Use only a random file, containing a number like \"1234\", as seed input.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "#### Setting-2\n",
    "Use the same seed corpus in Setting-1 and use a so-called fuzzing dictionary. A fuzzing dictionary contains predefined tokens that can be randomly inserted into the generated input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named fuzz.dict that contains three tokens as below. Inside the Docker container, you can use simple text editors like vim or nano to create this file.\n",

    "#### Setting-3\n",
    "Use a seed corpus containing a valid input file that adheres to the specified format. The \"printf\" command is used to generate a valid file that has a single chunk of type \"CHUK\" and the chunk's data consists of four bytes. Note that all numbers are stored in little-endian order so \"\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\" is 0x04 in hexadecimal and 4 in decimal.\n",

    "\n",
    "To trigger the fault in this version of read_and_process, in addition to FAULT-1's conditions, AFL needs to generate an input file that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "-\tThe data of the BOOM chunk contains two 4-byte integer numbers named x and y.\n",
    "-\tThe values of x and y must satisfy this constraint: (x + y > 283) && (x + y < 286)\n",
