    "The aim of this tutorial is for you to familiarise yourself with generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing. In today's session, we will first reflect on mutation-based fuzzing a bit more using last week's example. And then, we will use generation-based/model-based black-box fuzzing tools like Peach fuzzer to generate inputs to trigger the faults in two versions of the read_and_process program. "

    "We will look at two exercises in which you are asked to apply these fuzzing techniques to discover the faults in two versions of a program named `read_and_process.c` (stored in `read_and_process.zip`). This program mimics some functionalities of media processing libraries like LibPNG. The program takes a file as input and the file is expected to adhere to a specific format. A valid file starts with a 4-byte \"signature\". After that, the file contains a list of chunks and each chunk has three parts: i) a chunk type stored in 4 bytes, ii) a 4-byte data length, and iii) the chunk data.\n",

    "Use the input model and use generation-based fuzzing (`generation_fuzzer.sh`) to automatically generate an input to trigger that fault. You would need to update the fuzzer scripts to capture SIGABORT (return code = 134) instead of SIGFAULT (return code = 139).\n",
